Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## GOOGLE MAPS

Hello and welcome, we will be exploring some functionality of the google maps library for react.

## Setup

The short answer is to use `npm install '@vis.gl/react-google-maps'` (single quotes needed for powershell).

The long answer is to read the official documentation regarding the installation and usage on the [visgl webpage](https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/docs/get-started).

## Examples

Examples can be found on the official Github as well at [visgl GitHub](https://github.com/visgl/react-google-maps).

Other coding examples I used as reference are from [Leigh Halliday](https://github.com/leighhalliday) - Thanks buddy for helping me get off the ground with this ðŸ˜‡.

We will be creating a couple of map pages to show off some of the common usages of this library. Topics will include a simple map, placing markers, creating clusters, and calling secondary librarys ( places, geolocation, routes ).
